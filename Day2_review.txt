# Day 2 Review

## Opperators
### Equality/Comparison Operators
	==	equality (keep .equals() in mind)
	!= 	inequality
	>	greater than
	<	less than
	<=	less than or equal to
	>= 	greater than or equal to
### Arithmetic
	+	add
	-	subtract
	*	multiply
	/	divide
	%	modulous - gives remainder ( 3%2 = 1 --> 3/2 = 1 R 1)
	()	orders
### Logical
	&&	AND with short circuiting (stops when a false if reached)
	||	OR  with short circuiting (stops when one is true)
### Bitwise
		true	false
	&	both	one		- AND (looks at all conditions even if a false is already reached)
	|	one	both		- OR (looks at all conditions even if you already hit a true)
	^	either but not both	- EXCULUSIVE OR (one has to be true and one false for this to be true, if both are true or both are false it will pass false) 
### Unary
	!	negation	ex. boolean b = true; !b = false;
	++	increment, equivalent to += 1
	--	deincrement, equivalent to -= 1
### Ternary
	?	ex. x == 5 ? code to execute if true : code to execute if false;
		ex. z == 5 || y == 6 ? print(true) : print(false);
### Assignment
	=	assign a value to a location in memory (a variable)
	+=
	-=
	/=
	*=
	%=
		ex. this.age = this.age + 5; ===> this.age += 5;
		ex. this.age += 1; this.age++; post-increment
		ex. ++this.age; pre-increment
